/**
 * Which rule-deny codes cap a 板砖 run's status (ADR 0047 §2, amended
 * 2026-09-29).
 *
 * Finding 6: a run whose mutations were refused — by the user or by policy —
 * must not report 完成. A rule-deny counts as that refusal unless it is
 * provably not one. The line between them is one question:
 *
 *   would the SAME change, asked correctly, be allowed?
 *
 * Yes → the call itself was wrong, and the model fixes it by calling again:
 * a malformed argument, an edit anchor that does not match, a target in the
 * wrong state, a file not read first. Nothing was refused. The editors plan
 * their edit inside the permission rule, so what would otherwise be a tool
 * failure — which never caps the status — arrives as a rule-deny. A live run
 * (todo lab, 2026-09-29) that finished everything read 部分完成 because its
 * first edit used a relative path (`path_not_absolute`).
 *
 * No → a refusal: policy withheld the change (outside the workspace, a
 * denied path, a blocked command), or the tool cannot make it however it is
 * asked (a file too large or binary to edit, a read that failed). These
 * count, as does every code not listed in either set — unknown stays
 * conservative.
 *
 * The rules that return these codes live in @herta/tools; its
 * `deny-codes.test.ts` fails when a rule returns a code decided in neither
 * set, so a new code is decided here, once.
