/**
 * The working state the harness keeps for 板砖 once old iterations have been
 * dropped from its transcript (2026-09-29 long-run study, proposal 2).
 *
 * The budget trim drops whole old groups and leaves a count. Four things
 * then vanish that the model cannot cheaply work out again: the files it
 * has changed, the background commands still running (their ids were in a
 * dropped launch result), the conclusions it has recorded (so at the ledger's
 * cap it cannot consolidate), and what the user said while it worked (a
 * steer sits in a droppable group). This block states them from the
 * harness's own records — deterministic, never model-written — in the state
 * trailer after the transcript, so the cached prefix is untouched. Claude Code rebuilds the same kind of state after a
 * compaction; Codex rebuilds its context from live state. Herta never
 * summarizes, so this is the whole of it.
