 * The verb of the op row a call becomes — `workflowLabel` in the record
 * projection (`@herta/herta`), mirrored here because the desktop does not
 * import the harness. Null for a call with no op row (report_finding,
 * view_image). `viewing`: an editor call that only views a file (a read).
 *
 * Both the live feed (which numbers the calls that make op rows) and the
 * trace card (which names them) read it, so the two never disagree about
 * which calls count. A drift from the projection costs a moment: a live
 * step reads differently from the row that replaces it.
