/**
 * What the agent channel carries to the renderer: SIGNALS, not payloads.
 *
 * The session's agent stream is raw by contract — every bus event, whole,
 * for callers that want traces. The renderer is not one of them: its store
 * reads an event's type and layer, a report's status, an error's kind and
 * the actor's delta text, and ignores the rest. Forwarding the stream as it
 * came meant structured-cloning (once for the IPC, once more through the
 * context bridge) one event per 板砖 token, every tool result in full — a
 * 2000-line read, a `view_image` data URI of several megabytes — every
 * assistant message with its reasoning and tool inputs, every patch preview
 * and the whole execution report, and waking the renderer for each of them
 * to throw it away (perf audit 2026-09-20).
 *
 * So the forwarder decides per event type, here and nowhere else:
 *   – an event the renderer has no use for is not sent (`null`);
 *   – one it counts or branches on is sent with its heavy fields emptied,
 *     still a valid `AgentEvent`, so the wire type does not change.
 * What the user READS never rode this channel: record blocks, the approval
 * overlay and the turn lifecycle have their own.
 *
 * The switch is exhaustive on purpose. A new `AgentEvent` variant does not
 * compile until someone decides, here, whether the renderer needs it — the
 * default for a payload is "no".
