/**
 * The trace card's ticker, paced for the eye (2026-09-30).
 *
 * The live feed lands ten times a second, and a flash model writes a file in
 * two or three of those: shown as it lands, the ticker flashed half-written
 * fragments (`  if (!`, `  const`) for 100 ms each — 47 of 83 ticker states in
 * three lab runs — and then parked on whatever the step's last line was,
 * often a lone `}`, until the next step began. The pacer sits between the
 * feed and the line:
 *
 * - a shown line holds for `dwellMs` at least; after that the ticker jumps to
 *   the newest line, passing over the ones in between (not every line has to
 *   be seen — the stream has to read as a stream);
 * - only whole lines of what is written: a line still growing waits until a
 *   newer one begins, or until it stops changing — except a command being
 *   written, whose growing END shows (a one-line command is never whole
 *   until it runs, and its newest characters are the news);
 * - lines with no words pass: `}`, `});`, `]`, a bare `//`;
 * - when the step ends it settles on its headline — what the step DID: a
 *   written file's first declaration, an edit's first added line, a
 *   command's last line of output;
 * - a step over before two of its lines were seen plays two of them on the
 *   way to its headline, so even an instant write reads as content flowing.
 *
 * Pure: the caller hands it the view and the time and re-asks at `wakeAt`
 * when nothing new lands. Display only, like the ticker itself (ADR 0073).
