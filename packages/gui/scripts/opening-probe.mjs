/**
 * The opening probe (2026-09-28, ADR 0068 §19). The opening draws on a worker
 * from a glyph sheet the app keeps between launches (§15–§18), all of it
 * verified only on Windows until this probe ran on the macOS and Linux
 * runners. It LAUNCHES the app itself, so it can attach before the opening
 * starts, and checks one launch:
 *
 *   - the four launch marks arrive (app painted, opening painted, revealed,
 *     interactive) — the opening played to the end;
 *   - the opening-painted mark says the WORKER drew it, and the sheet's
 *     origin is the expected one: `drawn` on a fresh profile, `kept` on the
 *     launch after (`any` accepts either, `none` expects text);
 *   - every frame of the opening holds the figure: the page is screencast
 *     from the moment the probe attaches (before it asks the page anything
 *     — see startScreencast) to the end, each frame dated by its own swap
 *     time, its ink (pixels far from the background's luminance) measured
 *     in the page after the opening. From the frame where the figure has
 *     developed through the first quarter of the dissolve, each must keep a
 *     quarter of the hold's ink. A frame without is a flash; up to five are
 *     saved as opening-<label>-blank-<ms>.jpg. The longest stretch without
 *     a frame is reported, not judged;
 *   - no uncaught exception in the page.
 *
 *   node opening-probe.mjs <outDir> <label> <drawn|kept|any|none> -- <command…>
 *
 * The command is the app (or `xvfb-run … <AppImage>`); the debug-port switch
 * is appended to it. Prints `OPENING PROBE <label>: PASS`, `FAIL (…)`, or —
 * when the recording began only after the reveal, so no frame of the opening
 * exists to judge — `NOT OBSERVED (…)` with a CI warning (the marks are
 * still judged, and it exits 0). Writes opening-<label>.json and .jpg, exits
 * 1 on FAIL. The app is closed
 * (SIGTERM to its process group, then SIGKILL) and its port waited out
 * before the probe returns, so the next launch is not refused by the
 * single-instance lock.

/**
 * The page's screencast, started the moment the probe is attached (2026-09-30).
 * It used to start once the opening-painted mark was seen — and a mark is seen
 * by evaluating in the page, which waits for the renderer's main thread. On a
 * cold first launch of a freshly signed app on the macOS runner that thread is
 * busy booting until ~3.4 s: the probe's first frame came AFTER the reveal,
 * so a drawn opening was reported as "no glyphs in any frame" (v0.1.7's two
 * release builds, while every launch mark was normal). The screencast is
 * served by the browser process: started before anything asks the page, it
 * sees the opening from its first frame whatever the main thread is doing.
 *
 * Each frame is { how, swapped, data }: `swapped` is its own swap time
 * (seconds, the browser's epoch clock), turned into the page's clock later
 * — reading `performance.timeOrigin` is itself a main-thread evaluation. The
 * FIRST frame is dropped: it can be stale (on Linux at scale 2 it was a flat
 * fill without even the window controls, which exist from React's first
 * paint — the trap opening-flash.mjs met in a late-started trace, ADR 0068
 * §18). `stop()` ends it and returns the frames.
