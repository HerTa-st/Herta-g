 *
 * Asynchronous throughout: this runs on the desktop app's main thread
 * (ADR 0068).

/**
 * The running processes that are, or descend from, the process a run
 * recorded (`pid`, started at `startedAt`). Empty when nothing of it runs.
 *
 * - The recorded process itself, when its pid still runs AS it (start time).
 * - Windows: everything below it by parent id. A parent's death does not
 *   rewrite its children's parent id, so a launcher that exited still leads
 *   to what it started. Each child must have started after its parent, and
 *   when the parent's pid now names a later process, before that one — its
 *   own children are someone else's.
 *   A parent that is GONE has one more bound, `notAfter`: the pid may have
 *   been held in between by a process that started children of its own and
 *   exited — Windows reuses pids fast, and hours may pass before the
 *   relaunch — so a child of a dead parent is taken only when it started
 *   while the run's app was still alive (review 2026-09-30). A child the
 *   launcher started after the app died is left alone: that is the safe
 *   direction, and the launcher itself is caught when it still runs.
 *   Once a node is found running, its own children need no such bound: it
 *   has held its pid since it started.
 * - POSIX: the members of its process group (the run's commands are group
 *   leaders, and an orphan keeps its group) that started after it — unless
 *   the pid now names a later process, which the kernel only allows once
 *   the group is empty. A leader that is GONE takes the same `notAfter`
 *   bound: the kernel hands its pid out again once the group empties, and a
 *   later leader that took it, formed its own group and exited leaves
 *   members that look exactly like ours (CI 2026-09-30 — the morning's bound
 *   had reached only the Windows walk).
