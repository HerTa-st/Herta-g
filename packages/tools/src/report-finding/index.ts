 * channel at all (D6). For an analysis brief that meant the deliverable
 * evaporated: 板砖 read the log, said `部分完成`, and Herta re-did the
 * analysis from her own prompt. This tool is the channel: one call per
 * conclusion, and the harness projects it into the record and lists it in
 * the done marker under `↳ 结论`.
 *
 * WHY CITATIONS ARE VERIFIED. A conclusion nobody can check is not evidence;
 * a fabricated `path:line` must fail HERE, at the tool, not later in Herta's
 * mouth. Every cite is resolved through the same path guard as a read (the
 * attachment / log carve-outs included), must exist, and a line range must
 * lie inside the file. That makes a recorded finding quote-grade by
 * construction — the same stance ADR 0036 took for evidence in the record.
