/**
 * The usage log (perf audit 2026-09-20): every model call's token counts as
 * the API stated them, one JSON object per line —
 *
 *   {"at":"…","endpoint":"completion","model":"deepseek-v4-pro",
 *    "prompt":21930,"hit":21504,"miss":426,"completion":188}
 *
 * — so "is the prompt cache holding?" has a measured answer: `hit / prompt`
 * per call, by endpoint (completion = Herta; chat = 板砖 and the sidecars)
 * and model. Numbers only; see `ProviderUsage` for what is deliberately not
 * in it.
 *
 * Beside them, one line per 板砖 run and per Herta turn (long-run study item
 * 6, `UsageNote` in @herta/core), told apart by `note`:
 *
 *   {"at":"…","note":"backend-run","steps":37,"clearedSteps":12,
 *    "droppedSteps":3,"maxDropped":16,"peakSent":198000,
 *    "peakUntrimmed":260000,"budget":200000}
 *   {"at":"…","note":"actor-turn","calls":4,"firstPrompt":21930,
 *    "peakPrompt":38000,"highWater":…}
 *
 * — how often the backend trim bites, and how far Herta's prompt grows
 * inside a turn. Sizes there are the harness's estimates, the unit its
 * budgets are kept in.
 *
 * Installs the providers' and core's process-wide sinks, so one call covers
 * every provider and run the host builds. Writes are queued and
 * asynchronous — a model call never waits on the disk — and a failed write
 * is dropped: the log is an instrument, not a record. Returns the
 * uninstaller, which also resolves once the queue has drained (tests,
 * shutdown).
